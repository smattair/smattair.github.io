title: "My Projects"
---

In Spring of 2025 I took a Quantitative Reasoning class.

-   In this assignment, I learned how to build my own user site using GitHub

-   It includes my Github repository with access to all of my code for the project

-   I included images of me, paragraphs about me, as well as my projects.

-   It also includes my professional information like my LinkedIn and my resume

-   I learned how to overcome issues and recognize where my errors occurred while building this website

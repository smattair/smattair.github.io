Hi!! My name is Sierra Mattair and this is my first website! I'm majoring in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability at Colorado State University. I love being outside and being in nature. I enjoy the deep forest, bodies of water, hikes, and road trips. I love learning new things and expanding my knowledge as a student! Enjoy exploring my site!
